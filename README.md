# Hi, I'm Victor-Teodor üëã

Computer Engineering student in Bucharest, turning data and ideas into working software. I enjoy end-to-end problem solving‚Äîfrom data prep and feature engineering to clean code, reproducible experiments, and simple dashboards that surface the signal.

- üî≠ Recent project: **Solar Suitability Map** ‚Äî a geospatial ML pipeline using satellite imagery + DEM to score PV locations (features like NDVI/NDWI/NDBI, slope; outputs: GeoTIFF + interactive map).
- üí° Interests: ML/AI, MLOps, data engineering, geospatial analytics, energy & sustainability.
- üß∞ Toolbox: **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), **C/C++**, **Java**, Git, Linux/WSL, basic web (HTML/CSS/JS), raster/geospatial (rasterio, GeoTIFF).
- üìö I care about code quality (readability, tests), clear docs, and iterative delivery.

## What I'm up to
- Building small, shippable ML/data tools and improving reproducibility.
- Exploring orchestration/tracking (Airflow/MLflow-style), and cloud basics (AWS/GCP).
